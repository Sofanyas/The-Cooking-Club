# The Cooking Club
The Cooking Club is a web-based platform designed for culinary enthusiasts. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the jQuery library to offer an interactive experience. As my first project, it reflects my growing understanding of web development while demonstrating my grasp of essential web technologies and my interest in creating user-focused content. This project is a starting point in my journey of learning and applying web development skills.

## Files and Structure 
The project consists of several files across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- HTML files (`index.html`, `recipes.html`, `contact.html`) create the webpage structure.
- CSS files (`index.css`, `recipes.css`, `contact.css`) style the webpage elements.
- JavaScript files (`index.js`, `recipes.js`, `contact.js`) add interactive features.

### Requirements
To view and interact with The Cooking Club, you need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A text editor for code modifications (optional)

### Usage
To access the platform, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. Navigate through the website using the links provided in the navigation bar.

## Features
Each HTML file corresponds to a different section of The Cooking Club:

- `index.html`: Home page with general information about the club.
- `recipes.html`: A collection of cooking recipes.
- `contact.html`: Contact form and information for inquiries.
